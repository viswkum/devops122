# Batch Operations with node-postgres

## Overview

This code example demonstrates how to perform batch DELETE and UPDATE operations in Amazon Aurora DSQL
when working with datasets exceeding the 3,000-row transaction mutation limit. The example uses
[node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) with the
[Aurora DSQL Node.js Connector](https://github.com/awslabs/aurora-dsql-nodejs-connector) for automatic
IAM authentication.

Two patterns are provided:

- **Sequential**: A single-threaded loop that processes rows in configurable-size batches (default 1,000),
  committing each batch as a separate transaction.
- **Parallel**: Multiple concurrent async workers each process a disjoint partition of the dataset using
  `hashtext()` partitioning, with each worker running its own batch loop.

Both patterns include OCC (Optimistic Concurrency Control) retry logic with exponential backoff.

## About the code example

Aurora DSQL limits each transaction to 3,000 row mutations. To DELETE or UPDATE more than 3,000 rows,
you must split the work into batches, each committed as a separate transaction.

The parallel pattern partitions rows across workers using
`abs(hashtext(id::text)::bigint) % num_workers = worker_id`, ensuring workers operate on disjoint sets of rows
and reduce OCC conflicts with each other.

⚠️ **Important**

- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
- Each batch is a separate transaction. A failure mid-way leaves the dataset partially modified.
  Design your operations to be idempotent where possible.

## Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region configured as described
  in the [Globally configuring AWS SDKs and tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/creds-config-files.html) guide.
- Node.js 18 or later.
- You must have an Aurora DSQL cluster. For information about creating a cluster, see the
  [Getting started with Aurora DSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) guide.

## Set up

Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

## Set up the test table

Before running the examples, create and populate the test table. Aurora DSQL uses IAM authentication,
so you need to generate a fresh auth token each time you connect with `psql`:

```bash
export CLUSTER_ENDPOINT="<your-cluster-endpoint>"
export CLUSTER_REGION="<your-region>"

# Generate a fresh auth token (expires in 3600 seconds)
export PGPASSWORD=$(aws dsql generate-db-connect-admin-auth-token \
  --hostname $CLUSTER_ENDPOINT \
  --region $CLUSTER_REGION \
  --expires-in 3600)

psql "host=$CLUSTER_ENDPOINT dbname=postgres user=admin sslmode=verify-full sslrootcert=system" \
  -f batch_test_setup.sql
```

## Run the example

Set environment variables for your cluster:

```bash
# e.g. "admin"
export CLUSTER_USER="admin"

# e.g. "foo0bar1baz2quux3quuux4.dsql.us-east-1.on.aws"
export CLUSTER_ENDPOINT="<your-cluster-endpoint>"
```

Run the demo:

```bash
node src/main.js --endpoint "$CLUSTER_ENDPOINT" --user "$CLUSTER_USER"
```

### Command-line options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--endpoint` | (required) | Aurora DSQL cluster endpoint |
| `--user` | `admin` | Database user |
| `--batch-size` | `1000` | Rows per batch transaction (must be < 3000) |
| `--num-workers` | `4` | Number of parallel async workers |

## Clean up

After running the demo, drop the test table to avoid unnecessary storage:

```bash
export CLUSTER_ENDPOINT="<your-cluster-endpoint>"
export CLUSTER_REGION="<your-region>"

# Generate a fresh token if the previous one expired
export PGPASSWORD=$(aws dsql generate-db-connect-admin-auth-token \
  --hostname $CLUSTER_ENDPOINT \
  --region $CLUSTER_REGION \
  --expires-in 3600)

psql "host=$CLUSTER_ENDPOINT dbname=postgres user=admin sslmode=verify-full sslrootcert=system" \
  -c "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS batch_test;"
```

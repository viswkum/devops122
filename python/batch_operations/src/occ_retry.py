    Runs ``operation(connection)`` and retries on serialization failures
    (SQLSTATE 40001) using exponential backoff. Each retry rolls back the
    current transaction before waiting.

    Args:
        connection: A psycopg2 connection object.
        operation: A callable that accepts a connection and performs database
            work including commit. The operation should call ``conn.commit()``
            at the end so that commit-time serialization failures are retried.
        max_retries: Maximum number of retry attempts (default 3).
        base_delay_ms: Base delay in milliseconds for exponential backoff
            (default 100).

    Returns:
        The return value of ``operation(connection)``.

    Raises:
        MaxRetriesExceeded: If the operation fails with OCC conflicts after
            ``max_retries`` retry attempts.

# Aurora DSQL with Psycopg

## Overview

This code example demonstrates how to use Psycopg (version 3) with Amazon Aurora SQL (DSQL). The example shows you how
to connect to an Aurora DSQL cluster and perform basic database operations.

Aurora DSQL is a distributed SQL database service that provides high availability and scalability for
your PostgreSQL-compatible applications. Psycopg is a popular PostgreSQL adapter for Python that allows
you to interact with PostgreSQL databases using Python code.

## About the code example

This example uses the [Aurora DSQL Python Connector](https://github.com/awslabs/aurora-dsql-connectors/tree/main/python/connector) which automatically handles IAM token generation for authentication.

The example demonstrates a flexible connection approach that works for both admin and non-admin users:

* When connecting as an **admin user**, the example uses the `public` schema and generates an admin authentication token.
* When connecting as a **non-admin user**, the example uses a custom `myschema` schema and generates a standard authentication token.

The code automatically detects the user type and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## ⚠️ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the
  minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see
  [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see
  [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Run the example

### Prerequisites

* You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the
  [Globally configuring AWS SDKs and tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html)
  guide.
* [Python 3.8.0](https://www.python.org/) or later.
* You must have an Aurora DSQL cluster. For information about creating an Aurora DSQL cluster, see the
  [Getting started with Aurora DSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
  guide.
* If connecting as a non-admin user, ensure the user is linked to an IAM role and is granted access to the `myschema`
  schema. See the
  [Using database roles with IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/using-database-and-iam-roles.html)
  guide.

### Set up environment for examples

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux, macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

2. Install the required packages for running the examples:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the code

The example demonstrates the following operations:

- Opening a connection to an Aurora DSQL cluster
- Creating a table
- Inserting and querying data

The example is designed to work with both admin and non-admin users:

- When run as an admin user, it uses the `public` schema
- When run as a non-admin user, it uses the `myschema` schema

**Note:** running the example will use actual resources in your AWS account and may incur charges.

Set environment variables for your cluster details:

```bash
# e.g. "admin"
export CLUSTER_USER="<your user>"

# e.g. "foo0bar1baz2quux3quuux4.dsql.us-east-1.on.aws"
export CLUSTER_ENDPOINT="<your endpoint>"
```

Run the example:

```bash
python src/example_preferred.py
```

The example contains comments explaining the code and the operations being performed.

* [Psycopg Documentation](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/)

**Note:** The connector automatically extracts the region from the cluster endpoint, defaults to the `postgres` database, and handles SSL configuration.

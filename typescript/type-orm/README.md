# Aurora DSQL with TypeORM

## Overview

This code example demonstrates how to use `TypeORM` with Amazon Aurora DSQL. The example shows you how to connect to an Aurora DSQL cluster and perform basic database operations.

Aurora DSQL is a distributed SQL database service that provides high availability and scalability for your PostgreSQL-compatible applications. `TypeORM` is a popular ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript that allows you to interact with PostgreSQL databases using object-relational mapping patterns.

## About the code example

The example demonstrates a flexible connection approach that works for both admin and non-admin users:

- When connecting as an **admin user**, the example uses the `public` schema and generates an admin authentication
  token.
- When connecting as a **non-admin user**, the example uses a custom `myschema` schema and generates a standard
  authentication token.

The code automatically detects the user type and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## ⚠️ Important

- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
- We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the
  minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see
  [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
- This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see
  [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Run the example

### Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the
  [Globally configuring AWS SDKs and tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html)
  guide.
- [Node 18.0.0](https://nodejs.org) or later.
- You must have an Aurora DSQL cluster. For information about creating an Aurora DSQL cluster, see the
  [Getting started with Aurora DSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
  guide.
- If connecting as a non-admin user, ensure the user is linked to an IAM role and is granted access to the `myschema`
  schema. See the
  [Using database roles with IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/using-database-and-iam-roles.html)
  guide.

### Set up environment for examples

```
npm install
```

## Run the code

The example demonstrates the following operations:

- Opening a connection to an Aurora DSQL cluster
- Creating a table
- Inserting and querying data

The example is designed to work with both admin and non-admin users:

- When run as an admin user, it uses the `public` schema
- When run as a non-admin user, it uses the `myschema` schema

**Note:** running the example will use actual resources in your AWS account and may incur charges.

Set environment variables for your cluster details:

```bash
# e.g. "admin"
export CLUSTER_USER="<your user>"

# e.g. "foo0bar1baz2quux3quuux4.dsql.us-east-1.on.aws"
export CLUSTER_ENDPOINT="<your endpoint>"

# e.g. "us-east-1"
export REGION="<your region>"
```

Run the example:

```
# first time running the application
npm run build
npm run migrations-create-table
npm run migrations-run

npm test
```

The example contains comments explaining the code and the operations being performed.
